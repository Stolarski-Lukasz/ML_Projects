# Example scripts used in my machine learning projects

This repository contains scripts used in some of my machine learning projects. The scripts have been written using object-oriented programming (OOP) and follow SOLID principles. The file called "ml_module.py" contains classes which are imported and used in the main file "run.py". There is also a "settings.py" file where various parameters can be easily adjusted.Currently, the following scripts are included in the repository:

1. An example of a DNN regression model built for VowelMeter, a program for semi-automatic placement of vowels in the IPA Vowel Diagram .You can visit the program at [vowelmeter.pythonanywhere.com](https://vowelmeter.pythonanywhere.com) and see the source code at [github.com/Stolarski-Lukasz/VowelMeter](https://github.com/Stolarski-Lukasz/VowelMeter). The model is trained on articulations of Cardinal Vowels recorded by 14 phoneticians. The articulations have been normalized in Miller’s (1989) Auditory-Perceptual Space.
